## 🧬 Coding Philosophy

My work is grounded in these principles:

| Principle         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity > Cleverness** | Code should explain itself, even to future-you.                        |
| **Functional Core** | Minimize side effects; embrace pure functions and immutability.          |
| **Composable Design** | Build small, testable units that can be composed like Lego.             |
| **Fail Fast**     | Detect errors early with type safety and assertive validation.             |
| **Test Triangle** | Heavy on unit tests, light on end-to-end unless justified.                 |
